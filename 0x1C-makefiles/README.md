# Makefile

A Makefile is a script used to automate the build process of a software project. It provides a way to define a set of rules and dependencies for compiling source code files into executable programs, libraries, or other artifacts. The primary purpose of a Makefile is to enable developers to avoid manually entering lengthy compilation commands each time they make changes to their codebase.
