# Hash table
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows efficient retrieval and storage of key-value pairs. It is based on the concept of hashing, which involves mapping keys to indices of an array, called the hash table.

The basic idea behind a hash table is to use a hash function that takes a key as input and produces a hash code or hash value, which is an index in the array where the corresponding value can be stored or retrieved. Ideally, the hash function should evenly distribute the keys across the array to minimize collisions (when multiple keys produce the same hash code).

To store a key-value pair, the hash table applies the hash function to the key to determine the index where the value should be stored
