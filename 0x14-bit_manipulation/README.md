## Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation in C involves performing operations on the individual bits of an integer value using bitwise operators. 
The bitwise operators in C include:

Bitwise AND (&): Returns a 1 in each bit position where both operands have a 1.

Bitwise OR (|): Returns a 1 in each bit position where either operand has a 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): Returns a 1 in each bit position where only one operand has a 1.

Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts all the bits in the operand.

Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of bits.

Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of bits.
