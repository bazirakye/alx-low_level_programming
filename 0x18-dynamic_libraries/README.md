## Dynamic Libraries 

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are a type of library in the C programming language that allows code and resources to be shared among multiple programs.
Dynamic libraries are loaded into memory at runtime and linked to the program using them.
This is in contrast to static libraries, which are linked to the program at compile time.
